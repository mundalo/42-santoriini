# santoriini

In this project we randomly gathered together with a Hiver as a pair, team and we had 48h
to make a board game.
We had the option Santorini or Hive. We choosed Santorini and as a bonus made few of the God cards.

Here are [The official game rules](https://cdn.1j1ju.com/medias/fc/ec/5d-santorini-rulebook.pdf)

or you can also just jump into the game, we have a guide which tell you what to do step by step!:)
